* **Dodge + plague/regress**  - for the ring and shield at 30%


### Chat commands:
* **!VSNM-Lakan** - Toggles the module off/on
* **!VSNM-Lakan.party** - Toggles sending messages to party/yourself (yourself is default)

Commands are not case-sensitive. [slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) is supported but not required


### Known issues
* There's a missing "Next" message right after 30%


### Info:
* Messages starting with "Next: " are there to give you a heads up for what's coming.
* Messages without "Next: " means he's doing that mechanic right now.
* "Next" messages are sent 10s after he does an attack and after he says a message ('Lakan has noticed you', etc).


## Changelog 
### 1.0.1
* [+] Fixed minor bug where toggling messages to party/self would say the wrong one.
